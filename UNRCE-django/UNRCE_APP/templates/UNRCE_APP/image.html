      Remember the { for image in images } from the index.html?
      image is basically the Image model from the UNRCE_APP/models.py
    -->
    <h3>{{ image.title }}</h3>
    <!--
      Django generates image url for us. Since the image here is
      just an instance of the Image model from the UNRCE_APP/models.py
      we can access the underlying file by calling image.image
    -->
    <img src="{{ image.image.url }}"/>
